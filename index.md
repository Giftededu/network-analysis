# Social Network Analysis in STEM Ed Research

Although social network analysis and its educational antecedents date back to the early 1900s, the popularity of social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook have raised awareness of and renewed interests in networks and their influence. As the use of digital resources continues expand in education, data collected by these educational technologies has also greatly facilitated the application of network analysis to teaching and learning. These introductory modules are designed to prepare STEM   Education researchers and practitioners to apply network analysis in order to better understand and improve student learning and the contexts in which learning occurs. This course will provide LASER  scholars with an overview of social network theory, examples of network analysis in educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques. As participants gain experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout the course, they will be better prepared help educational organizations understand and improve both online and blended learning environments.

### SNA Module 1: An Introduction to SNA in STEM

Learning Lab 1: Tidy Text, Tokens, & Twitter. We take a closer look at the literature and research questions that will be guiding our analysis; importing data through Twitter's developer API; and wrangling our data into a one-token-per-row tidy text format.

Presentation | Tutorial | Practice

Learning Lab 2: Word Counts, Clouds & Correlations. For our second lab, we use simple summary statistics, data visualization, and word correlations to explore our data and see what insight they provides in response to our questions.

Learning Lab 3: Sentiment Analysis & School Reform. We focus on the use of lexicons to compare the sentiment of tweets about the NGSS and CCSS state standards in order to better understand public reaction to these two curriculum reform efforts. 

Presentation | Tutorial | Practice

Learning Lab 4: Select, Polish, & Narrate. We wrap our look at public sentiment around STEM state curriculum standards by selecting an analysis that provides some unique insight; refining or polishing a data product, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form; and writing a brief narrative explaining the ways in which the data product helps answer the research question.
